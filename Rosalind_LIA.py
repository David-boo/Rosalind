# Code is quite easy if you spot the formula.

# Any combination of any genotype of egg with sperm from a heterozygous will result in a probability of obtaining an AaBb offspring in any generation of 0.25.

# The probability of there being n or more successes (AaBb) is equivalent to the probability of there being (2k)âˆ’n or less failures (everything not AaBb) (There are 2k 'trials')

# This forms a binomial distribution and we can apply formula using our data.
